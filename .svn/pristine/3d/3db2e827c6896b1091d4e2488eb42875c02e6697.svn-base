When running large inputs, such as a million post inputs, My program is
taking a substantial amount of time inbetween lines 69 and 79. I have tried to
debug and I notice that number at first grows very quickly to about 270000 and then begins to go very slow. I was unable to attach the million post
input because it was too big. I am unsure where the problem is. number.add(temp)
should run in O(1) time and I'm not sure why any of the other methods would take
increasingly more time as the input got larger. Thanks!
